My own Tetris clone, written for fun and to learn stuff.

For now this game is going to be a simple clone of plain old Tetris. It uses JavaFX 2 for graphics, and JInput for receving input from the player.

Plans for the future of this project:

* get single player to a fully playable state;
* add local multiplayer;
* add rollback-based netcode, in order to support online multiplayer over LAN or the internet.

Other ideas for possible future work:

* spin off the netcode into its own separate open source project?
* add an Android port?
* add software for an online matchmaking server?
